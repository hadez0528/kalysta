## About Project
This project provides an intuitive way for new to explore some preconfigured FLINT modules, including the Generic Budget Carbon Model (GCBM), in order to better understand how the FLINT system works. Our client is written as a Web application and can be used in a local or remote environment. Please contact us if you'd like help deploying your cloud instance or customizing the client.

## Built with
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com/)
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
* [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps)

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
In order to use and work on this project you need to install Docker for running the Docker image and Yarn to run the Vue app locally.

You can install Docker following the download's [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

In order to install Yarn, open a terminal and type:
```shell
npm install -g yarn
```

### Installation
To set up this project locally follow the below procedure:

1. Pull the below docker image to run `flint.example`:

```shell
docker pull shubhamkarande13/flint.example:bionic
```

2. Clone [FLINT.UI](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI) repository:

When using submodules the installation code needs to be:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/moja-global/flint-ui
```

Or if you've already initialized the repository without the submodule

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Now get inside the repository directory and build the `docker-compose.yml` file by following the below command:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

This will build all the docker images inside the `docker-compose.yml` file. It will take some time and after that, you can see all images list in the Docker app.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/docker-images.jpg">
</div>

<br />

`docker-compose.yml` file is composed of three services i.e. `flint.example.api`, `flint.gcbm.api`, `flint.ui`.

Now you can start all the containers by clicking on the `START` button or using the command `docker-compose up`. You can also use the command `docker start {name of the container}` to start the only specific container.

All containers list will look like this in the Docker app:

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/docker-containers.jpg">
</div>

<br />

If you want to shut down a specific container click on the `STOP` button of that specific container in the Docker app. You can also use the command line to stop a specific container by using the command `docker stop {name of the container you want to stop}`.

To shut down, the whole `docker-compose.yml` file and all services inside it then use the command `docker-compose down`.

> You can also run `docker-compose.yml` in Detached mode. Detached mode, shown by the option `--detach` or `-d`, means that a Docker container runs in the background of your terminal. It does not receive input or display output. So the command for running `docker-compose up` in Detached mode is `docker-compose up -d`.

4. To view the UI please navigate to [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/). UI will look something like this:

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/flint-ui-dashboard.jpg">
</div>

## Developer notes
### Vue app
To run the Vue app locally, you can follow the below procedure:

1. Go to the `flint.ui` folder and run `yarn install`.
2. Run `yarn serve` to start the Vue app server.
3. Go to [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view the Vue app.

### Storybook in local development

Storybook dependencies and configuration are located under the `flint.ui/.storybook` directory.

To build and launch Storybook locally, we have to follow the below procedure:

Go to the `flint.ui` directory.

1. Install Storybook dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

2. Start the Storybook in development mode:

```shell
yarn storybook
```

Go to [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006/) to view the Storybook.

### Storybook in production

We have deployed Storybook on [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/). It is made by Storybook maintainers. Chromatic automates gathering UI feedback, visual testing, and documentation, so developers can iterate faster with less manual work.

* Get a permalink to FLINT-UIâ€™s latest published Storybook on a given branch. Replace `<branch>` with the designated branch.

```shell
https://<branch>--612f3734da98c9003a398626.chromatic.com
```

* Get a permalink to the latest published component or library on a given branch. Add the `&branch=<branch>` query parameter to the url.

```shell
https://chromatic.com/library?appId=612f3734da98c9003a398626&branch=<branch>
```

Storybook live (master branch): [https://master--612f3734da98c9003a398626.chromatic.com](https://master--612f3734da98c9003a398626.chromatic.com)

### Dependency management

We are following [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.

Our `package.json` file is gitignored to enforce strict management of our client dependencies.

In order to add a new dependency, please:

1. use `yarn add <your-package>`
2. `git checkout -b dependency/<your-package>`
3. `git add --force flint.ui/package.json`
4. `git push` and submit a PR with only the `package.json` changes

Our CI build will test for conflicts and your new dependency will be added after your PR has been reviewed.

### Code Style

The Vue.js style guide has been used to maintain a consistent style throughout the project. Click [here](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) to learn more about the style guide.

One exception is the case used to describe the ecological models exposed to our FLINT client. Because model names, and sometimes model variables, often use acronyms these remain capitalized.

Obvious examples are:

- GCBM: Generic Carbon Budget model
- FLINT: Full Lands Integration Tool
- RothC: Rothamstead Carbon model

We recommend using ESLint and the Prettier plugins to make conforming to the Vue style guide easy. There is official integration for VSCode and other editors. Find out more [here](https://eslint.vuejs.org/user-guide/).

If you have ESLint installed globally, you can run it from the `flint.ui` directory. For example, this will detect any errors in the `src` folder:

```shell
eslint --ext .js,.vue src
```

Minor errors can be fixed automatically:

```shell
eslint --fix --ext .js,.vue src
```
